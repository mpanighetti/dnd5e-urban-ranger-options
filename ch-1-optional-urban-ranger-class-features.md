# Chapter 1: Optional Urban Ranger Class Features

The options presented below can be selected by any ranger using the Favored Enemy and Natural Explorer features, but they are particularly suited toward the City Dweller ranger subclass, described later in this document.

You gain class features in the _Player's Handbook_ when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a ranger. Unlike the features in the _Player's Handbook_, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your Dungeon Master, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

### Favored Enemy Options

_1st-level ranger feature_

When you choose a favored enemy, the following enemies are added to your list of options.

#### [City Denizens](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-classes/blob/main/ranger/options-favored-enemy.md#city-denizens)

This option adds the citizenry of a specific city as one of the selectable favored enemy types in the ranger's Favored Enemy feature. With the Dungeon Master's consent, you can select the people of one city any time you would normally select a humanoid species as a favored enemy, since two members of the same intelligent species do not necessarily have shared mannerisms or behaviors that a hunter could specialize in, whereas a city's denizens fall into identifiable rhythms and patterns that a people-watcher could readily pick up on.

The pace and flow of a life in any two cities are sufficiently different that people from each city would be considered separate favored enemies. This means that you can identify people who hail from your favored enemy city even if you find them in another location.

### Natural Explorer Options

_1st-level ranger feature_

When you choose a favored terrain, the following terrains are added to your list of options.

#### [Cities](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-classes/blob/main/ranger/options-natural-explorer.md#cities)

This option adds cities as one of the selectable favored terrains in the ranger's Natural Explorer feature. This terrain includes all urban settlements of any size, from a small town to a sprawling metropolis.
